**LinguaDex**


LinguaDex is an application that allows users to add flashcards and keep track of the progress they are making
in acquiring new vocabulary. Many people see language learning as daunting, and I feel that a good way to encourage
people to keep learning is to show them how much progress they have been making by segmenting their journey into 
quantifiable milestones.One way to do this is by looking at how many hours of focused learning the average 
person takes to learn a language. (Estimates for how long it will take a native ENglish speaker to learn another language
can be found here: http://web.archive.org/web/20071014005901/http://www.nvtc.gov/lotw/months/november/learningExpectations.html)

Another way to approach track language learning is through estimating how many words one knows at different levels
of proficiency. According to Helen Doron's site (http://www.helendoron.com/arch_fluent_english.php), 

The amount of words needed for different levels of fluency are as follows: 

 Crawl' level: 400-500 words, about 150 phrases. You can make yourself somewhat understood and understand slow speech.
 Mini level: 800-1000 words and 300 phrases. Now you can speak relatively well and unstrained, and can read newspapers and books with the aid of a dictionary.
 Midi level: 1500-2000 words and more than 300 phrases. What you need for day to day conversations. During the course of one day you need approximately this amount of vocabulary, and you can take part in serious discussions and understand what is being said at normal speed.
 3000-4000 words: Sufficient for reading newspapers and magazines fluently.
 8000 words: All you ever need. More words are not necessary in order to communicate freely and read all types of literature.

 If one is learning an Indo-European language or one that does share the alphabet and syntactic similarity with English, 
we can assume that to be able to read and understand the majority of periodicals, one will need to know at least 3000 words.
If one studies and learns 30 words every day, this baseline level can be achieved in 100 days,
a little over three months.

The purpose of this application is to encourage the user to study and practice 30 words a day, and to review previously learned words. The application will keep track of how many words have been studied and will report progress to the user as they progress. When different levels of words have been achieved, the program will alert the user of what level they are at. 

A user will be able to study different languages, and the program will eventually keep track of levels of different languages. 

**How to Use Linguadex**

At the present time, a user can now sign up, log in, add decks, and take a recall quiz. 

**Future goals for enhancement include:**

Creating a deck of flashcards based on the 
Spaced repetition
Graphs of how frequently user logs in and progress over time
